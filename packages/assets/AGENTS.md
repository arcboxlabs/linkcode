# packages/assets — the daemon's managed-asset store

`@linkcode/assets` (CODE-111) downloads, verifies, atomically installs, and garbage-collects
the platform binaries LinkCode provisions for the user: the agent CLI pairs (claude-code /
codex / opencode) and standalone toolchains (tectonic). Daemon-only — clients see assets via
the `asset.list` wire resource; presentation belongs to the onboarding UI (CODE-112).

## Invariants

- **Trust lives in the pinned hash, not the source.** Every artifact resolves to an SRI digest
  (npm `dist.integrity` fetched per-version at runtime; GitHub sources hand-verified and baked
  into `catalog.ts`), and `urls` is an ordered multi-source list — sources are interchangeable,
  so a mirror or fallback never changes the trust model. The compat manifest (CODE-77) will
  replace baked/registry trust with a signed document; keep `ManagedAssetArtifact` (in
  `@linkcode/schema`) forward-compatible with it.
- **claude platform packages are proprietary** (© Anthropic PBC, all rights reserved): their
  URLs must always point at the npm registry — never mirror them to our own hosting. codex is
  Apache-2.0, opencode/tectonic MIT — mirrorable.
- **Version pins come from the installed carrier packages** (`version-pin.ts`): claude = its
  agent SDK's version, codex = the `@openai/codex` meta package's version (no JS SDK since the
  app-server rewrite), opencode = its SDK version; tectonic is a catalog constant. "Cannot pin"
  (`undefined`) means hands off: no install, and GC skips that asset entirely rather than risk
  deleting a working install.
- **Store layout** `<root>/<namespace>/<name>/<version>/<binary>` under the platform data dir
  (darwin `~/Library/Application Support/LinkCode/assets`; `LINKCODE_ASSETS_DIR` overrides —
  tests and E2E must set it). All paths resolve at call time so a fake `$HOME` redirects them.
  Installs stage in a `.tmp-*` sibling and publish with one same-volume `rename`; losing the
  rename race to a concurrent install is success (hash-verified identical bytes). Boot GC
  removes superseded versions and `.tmp-*` orphans, best-effort, before anything can spawn.
- **codex registry quirk:** `@openai/codex-<platform>` names are npm aliases that 404 — the
  real artifacts are `@openai/codex` versions keyed `<ver>-<platform>-<arch>`, with the binary
  at `package/vendor/<rust-triple>/bin/codex`. All members in `catalog.ts` were read off real
  tarballs; re-verify against a fresh tarball when bumping an SDK.
- **The fetch/verify/extract stack is npm's own, taken at the right layer**: `make-fetch-happen`
  (per-source retry + `HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` env support), `ssri` (integrity streams), `tar`
  (node-tar, pure JS — tgz extraction assumes no system tar), `semver`. This is deliberately
  pacote's engine *without* pacote: its extra layers (sigstore, run-script, git, packlist) are
  npm-CLI semantics that would enter the binary-installing path unused. `env-paths` was
  evaluated and rejected — it hardcodes a `\Data` level on win32 and captures `homedir` at
  module load, breaking call-time path resolution.
- Extraction takes exactly the declared member — no archive content is trusted beyond it. The
  one zip artifact (tectonic win32) shells out to the system bsdtar (System32 since Win10 1809;
  macOS tar is bsdtar too, keeping the branch testable on darwin).

## Consumers

The daemon constructs one `AssetManager` at boot: GC → `setManagedResolver` into
`agentRuntimeProber` (managed wins over detected the moment an install lands) → background
`ensure()` for agent pairs the probe found unusable. The engine serves `statuses()` on
`asset.list`, triggers `ensure()` on `asset.ensure`, and forwards install lifecycle to the wire
via the injected `AssetService`. Tectonic consumers (CODE-81) resolve by asset id.

Observers use `subscribe()` (progress / installed / failed events), never a per-call
`onProgress`: install.ts's in-flight dedupe keeps only the first caller's callback, so per-call
progress silently vanishes for the second concurrent caller. The flip side: each concurrent
`ensure()` emits its own `installed` event for the shared install — subscribers must revalidate
idempotently. A throwing subscriber is swallowed (an observer must not fail the install).
